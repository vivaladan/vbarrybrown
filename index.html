    <h1>Vikki Barry Brown</h1>
    <p>Hello, I’m Vikki, welcome to my site! I am a Leverhulme Doctoral Candidate in the School of Geography at Queen
        Mary University of London (QMUL) where my supervisors are <a
            href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/geog/staff/nashc.html">Professor Catherine Nash</a> and <a
            href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/geog/staff/brownt.html">Dr Tim Brown</a>.
        My PhD research ‘Being English in Ireland – English migration to Ireland, 1960 to the present’ is a qualitative
        project considering English people who have moved to Ireland, finding out how they experience identity,
        belonging and home through in-depth interviewing. You can read more about this research at the dedicated website
        <a href="https://englishinireland.vbarrybrown.com/">here</a>.</p>
    <p>I am part of the <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/ihss/people/doctoral-students/">Queen Mary University of London
            Leverhulme Trust Doctoral Scholarship Mobile People</a> cohort an interdisciplinary programme concerned with
        the transformative effects of mobile people on the social and political institutions they inhabit and construct.
    </p>
